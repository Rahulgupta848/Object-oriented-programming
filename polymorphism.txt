#polymorphism:-
 it means having many forms

there are two types of polymorphisms:-
     a.compile time (static)
     b.run time(dynamic)


A.Compile time polymorphism --- 
     In compile time polymorphism, the type of an object is known at compile time only and not during runtime. 
     This kind of polymorphism can be achieved  using function overloading or operator overloading in C++

     1. Function Overloading:
          functions with same name  but different parameters can be made.
     2. Operator overloading:
          operators can be mappped to a function to perform  some operation on objects.

B.Run time polymorphism
