class :-
        It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions,
         which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. 

syntax :-
     class Student{
          ....attributes
          ....attributes
          ....attributes
     };

Constructor :-
     it is used to initialize the class ,it is the 1st  function called when we create an object of a class.
     there are three types of constructor.
     a.default constructor (no parameters are passed)
     b.parameterized constructor (parameters are passed)
     c.copy constructor (it copys the data members of object  into another objects data members).


     A.Default constructor:-
          class Student {
               ...atributes.
               
               public:
                    Student(){
                         print("default constructor is called")
                    }
          };

          int main(){
               Student s; // calling default constructor
          }

     B.parameterized constructor :-
          class Student{
               int id;
               string name;

               public:
                    Student(int id,string name){
                         this->id = id;
                         this->name = name;
                    }
          }
          int main(){
               Student s(1, "John");// parameterized constructor;
          }


     C.Copy Constructor : -
          class Student{
               int id;
               string name;

               Student(const Student &obj){
                    this->id = obj.id;
                    this->name = obj.name;
               }
          }

          int main(){
               Student s1(1,"john");
               Student s2 = s1;  // copy constructor is called here;
          }
